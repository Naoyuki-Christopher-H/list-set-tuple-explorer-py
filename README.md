## OBJECTIVE

### PURPOSE

This project provides a hands-on exploration of Python's core collection types: lists, sets, and tuples. It demonstrates their properties, methods, and common operations through executable code examples.

- **Date of creation**: 2023-11
- **Badges**: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue)
- **Technical**:
  - **Laboratory**: Python 3.8+, VS Code
- **Installation Instructions**:
  - **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/Naoyuki-Christopher-H/list-set-tuple-explorer-py](https://github.com/Naoyuki-Christopher-H/list-set-tuple-explorer-py)
  - Clone the repository and run `main.py` in any Python-compatible IDE to see the output of list, set, and tuple operations.
- **Key Features**:
  - Demonstrates mutable vs. immutable collections.
  - Shows ordered vs. unordered behavior.
  - Highlights duplicate handling across types.
  - Includes membership tests and set operations (union, intersection, difference).
- **File Structure**:
  ```
